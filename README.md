# Financial Analysis with JavaScript

This JavaScript project analyzes financial data to calculate various metrics including the total number of months, net total amount of profit/losses, average change in profit/losses, greatest increase, and greatest decrease in profit/losses over a specified period.

## Getting Started

You can run this project by copying the provided JavaScript code into an HTML file and opening it in a web browser. The financial data is stored in the `finances` array, and the analysis results are displayed in the browser's console.

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Create an HTML file, e.g., `index.html`.

3. Copy and paste the JavaScript code into your HTML file.

4. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

5. View the results in the browser's console (usually accessible through the browser's developer tools).

## Project Details

The JavaScript code included in this project does the following:

- Calculates the total number of months in the dataset.
- Computes the net total amount of profit/losses.
- Determines the average change in profit/losses over the dataset.
- Identifies the greatest increase in profit/losses, including the date and amount.
- Identifies the greatest decrease in profit/losses, including the date and amount.

The financial data is stored in the `finances` array, which you can modify to analyze different datasets.

## Usage

1. Modify the `finances` array to include your financial data.

2. Open the HTML file containing the JavaScript code in a web browser.

3. Check the browser's console for the analysis results.

## Example Output

Here's an example of what the output will look like in the console:

```plaintext
Total number of months: 86
Net total amount of Profit/Losses: $38382578
Average change in Profit/Losses: $-2315.1176470588234
Greatest increase in Profit/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest decrease in Profit/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

```
